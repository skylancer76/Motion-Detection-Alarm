# Motion-Detection-Alarm

This project is a motion detection and alarm system implemented using Python and OpenCV. The system captures video from a webcam, detects motion by comparing frames, and triggers an alarm sound if significant motion is detected over a sustained period. Users can toggle motion detection mode on or off and stop the program with specific keyboard inputs.

## How to Use

1) Press 'b' to toggle motion detection mode.
2) Press 'q' to quit the program.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

1) Python 3.6 or later
2) opencv-python library
3) imutils library (for image resizing)
4) A webcam connected to your PC (internal or external)
